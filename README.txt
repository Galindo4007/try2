What Is Apache Hadoop?

The Apache™ Hadoop® project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing.

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.
It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage.
Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

The project includes these modules:

    Hadoop Common: The common utilities that support the other Hadoop modules.
    Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS™): A distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to application data.
    Hadoop YARN: A framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.
    Hadoop MapReduce: A YARN-based system for parallel processing of large data sets.

This distribution includes cryptographic software.  The country in 
which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import, 
possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of 
encryption software.  BEFORE using any encryption software, please 
check your country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the
import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to 
see if this is permitted.  See <http://www.wassenaar.org/> for more
information.

The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and
Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity 
Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security
software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric
algorithms.  The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation
distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception
ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS 
Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object 
code and source code.

software:
  Hadoop Core uses the SSL libraries from the Jetty project written
