## Overview

The `hadoop-qiniu` module provides support for Qiniu integration with
[Qiniu Kodo Storage Service](https://www.qiniu.com/products/kodo).
The generated JAR file, `hadoop-aliyun.jar` also declares a transitive
dependency on all external artifacts which are needed for this support â€” enabling
downstream applications to easily use this support.

To make it part of Apache Hadoop's default classpath, simply make sure
that HADOOP_OPTIONAL_TOOLS in hadoop-env.sh has 'hadoop-qiniu' in the list.
