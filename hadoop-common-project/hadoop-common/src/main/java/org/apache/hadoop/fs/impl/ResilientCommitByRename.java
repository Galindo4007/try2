   * The outcome of the operation is undefined if source is not a file, dest exists,
   * dest.getParent() doesn't exist/is a file.
   * That is: implementations SHOULD assume that the code calling this method has
   * set up the destination directory tree and is only invoking this call on a file.
   * Accordingly: <i>implementations MAY skip validation checks</i>
   *
   * If sourceStatus is not null, its contents MAY be used to qualify the rename.
   * <ol>
   *   <li>Values extracted from sourceStatus SHALL take priority over
   *       sourceEtag/sourceLastModified parameter.</li>
   *   <li>sourceStatus.getPath().getName() MUST equal source.getName()</li>
   *   <li>If store has a subclass of FileStatus and it is sourceStatus is of this type,
   *       custom information MAY be used to qualify/validate the request.
   *       This MAY include etag or S3 version ID extraction,</li>
   * </ol>
   *
   * Filesystems MAY support this call on an instance-by-instance basis, depending on
   * the nature of the remote store.
   * If not available the implementation MUST {@code ResilientCommitByRenameUnsupported}.
   * Callers SHOULD use a check of
   * {@code hasPathCapability(source, RESILIENT_COMMIT_BY_RENAME_PATH_CAPABILITY}
   * before trying to use this call.
   *
   * PostConditions on a successful operation:
   * <pre>
   * FS' where:
   *     not exists(FS', source)
   *     and exists(FS', dest)
   *     and data(FS', dest) == data (FS, source)
   * </pre>
   * This is exactly the same outcome as `FileSystem.rename()` when the same preconditions
   * are met. This API call simply restricts the operation to file rename with strict
   * conditions, (no need to be 'clever' about dest path calculation) and the ability
   * to pass in etags, modtimes and file status values.
   *
   * @param source path to source file
   * @param dest destination of rename.
   * @param sourceEtag etag of source file. may be null or empty
   * @param sourceStatus nullable FileStatus of source.
   * @throws FileNotFoundException source file not found
   * @throws ResilientCommitByRenameUnsupported not available on this store.
   * @throws PathIOException failure, including source and dest being the same path
   * @throws IOException any other exception
